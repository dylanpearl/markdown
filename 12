# Introduction

This is an example of using R Markdown to make R code, perform calculations, and visualize results. Below is a simple R code chunk that calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 10 and displays a plot.

# Sum Calculation

numbers <- 1:10
sum_numbers <- sum(numbers)

sum_numbers

# Plot Example

plot(numbers, 
     type = "o",               # 'o' means both points and lines
     col = "blue",             # Line color
     pch = 16,                 # Point shape (solid circle)
     main = "Simple Plot of Numbers",  # Plot title
     xlab = "Index",           # X-axis label
     ylab = "Value",           # Y-axis label
     lwd = 2                   # Line width
)

grid()
